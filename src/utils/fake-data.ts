    content:
      "I've been reading the same books for years. I don't enjoy heavy meaning in books thanks to several college courses on literature analysis so I mostly stick to YA novels. I don't object to violence or X rated activity, but I do prefer fantasy. \n\nBooks I've already read:\n\nThe Eragon series\n\nHarry Potter\n\nPercy Jackson and pretty much everything else Rick Riordan has written for teens.\n\nLOTR\n\nMost of Robin McKinley's stuff\n\nThe Wicked Lovely series by Melissa Marr\n\nFred the Vampire Accountant series\n\nHollow Kingdom series by Clare Dunkle\n\nHunger Games\n\nDivergent\n\nThe Giver\n\nThat's definitely not an exhaustive list of all the books I've ever read but it is what I can think of that fits the description. Appreciate any and all suggestions! Thanks Reddit!",

          content:
            "Hey there fellow coffee enthusiasts!\n\nAs we all know, James Hoffman is a revered name in the coffee world, and his contributions to the field are unparalleled. I have always enjoyed his YouTube channel and the myriad of brewing techniques he showcases, including the Aeropress recipe he shared.\n\nHowever, I've noticed something that I wanted to discuss with you all. I've been using Hoffman's Aeropress recipe for a while now, and while the results are always consistent, I've found that the brew often ends up tasting a bit bleak and bland for my liking. It's still a good cup of coffee, don't get me wrong, but I feel it lacks some depth and complexity that I crave in my brew.\n\nThe method is straightforward, no doubt, but I find that it could potentially result in under-extraction, especially for the lighter and more complex coffee beans. This could be the reason for the blandness I am experiencing. I try to mitigate this by grinding finer and using higher temperature for lighter roasts, so far without any success.\n\nMaybe the 1:18 ratio is just not enough?\n\nI wanted to share these thoughts with you all to gain some perspective. Have any of you experienced similar issues with Hoffman's Aeropress recipe? If so, how have you modified the method to better suit your palate? I appreciate any insights you could provide, and of course, constructive criticism is always welcome!\n\nRemember, this is all in the spirit of exploration and improvement, and by no means a knock on James Hoffman or his recipe. After all, coffee is a very personal experience and it's all about finding what works best for each of us.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you all!",

I think that describes this recipe pretty well: it&#39;s my standard daily recipe, and I can make it first thing in the morning when I&#39;m a zombie without thinking about it, and it&#39;s very good. If I have more time or feel like experimenting, I&#39;ll try something else, but this is my old reliable.</p>\n</div>',

The basic swirl technique at the beginning never did it for me. For Aeropress, I do the same thing. The pour and forget for 2 mins always left me with bland cups. I pour the 200g of water and then use the Aeropress paddle to give it a few good stirs before letting it sit for 2 mins and then do the small swirl at the end.</p>\n</div>',

After that I spread any fines my grinder produces evenly across the surface of the crust, which allows them to saturate for a couple of minutes. I sometimes go slightly longer on the immersion phase, anywhere from 10-20 seconds. I’ve found that swirling produces a more even coffee bed during the press, whereas stirring often leaves me with a mound/muffin-shaped puck. So all in all, pretty minor tweaks, but it helps to bring the most out of my cups.</p>\n</div>',

For those who need a refresher, they were mad because Cena made a public statement where he apologized to China for when he referred to Taiwan as a country. People were hating on him and saying he was a China sympathizer and shit.</p>\n\n<p>I was like, leave the dude alone! He was doing his best to try to navigate that no-win situation. He&#39;s not a fucking diplomat, there was no right answer for him there. You think he wants to get involved in complex international geopolitical issues? Nah, he just wants to do make-a-wish and help kids and do nice things for people. It was frustrating to see people give him grief while ignoring all the good he has done. I was just thinking, leave the guy alone and let him get back to making children smile.</p>\n</div>',

          content:
            "For some background, I’ve always been able to understand animals but I never knew it was an ability and thought I was going insane. My earliest memory of my ability was when my parents brought home a rescue dog as a gift after I begged them for a puppy and the dog started telling me it was going to kill me if I mistreated him like his previous owners and I burst into tears.\n\nMy parents assumed it was me being scared until I told them what he’d said and their faces showed a concerning look I only grew to become all too familiar with. Shortly after I was thrown from psychologist to psychologist becoming an object of research for varying anti-psychotics as the voices never went away.\n\nIt was only in my early teens that I really started to listen, I was at the tail end of my rebellious streak and had unofficially been off my medication and on my walks to school I’d hear all manner of things from birds planning how they’d build their nests to the ants having orders barked at them for their strict regiment and loyalty to their queen. I even got to know some ‘regulars’, there was a old dog that would sit on the porch of a house on my route named Gus, he told me his actual name was Tom and went into great detail about his life and how he was briefly a stray before being taken in and living a calm life away from his primitive past.\n\nIt’s not all it’s made up to be though, people still thought I was crazy when they caught me chatting to various bugs on the wall or having more profound interactions with pets beyond the condescending ‘who’s a good boy’ spiel. Once I was out of school and in the workplace I chose to ignore the animals I came across which became increasingly difficult as I’d gotten to know all the creatures in my immediate vicinity and I couldn’t afford to move away so I always had a handful of voices calling for me on my commute and it was like I was right back to being insane.\n\nA full year passed like this, ignoring the animals I had come to know and appreciate, I got along fine until they all stopped talking to me altogether and it was only then that I thought about what I’d done. I’d taken away their only bridge of communication between their world and ours, their only way to be really understood, and this gave me a change of heart.\n\nSo on my day off I went out and tried to talk to as many animals as I could to re-establish our connection and offer back what I’d ripped from them. But I heard nothing, I hadn’t noticed it before but the world was more silent than I’d ever known it to be but through my ignorance I never noticed. I ran to every creature and animal I saw, desperate to help, to listen, to hear something but all I got back was stern silence and several pleas to stop harassing people’s pets.\n\nI got so desperate that I went back to Tom’s porch, in the hopes that the old boy had pushed through the years and could be the voice of reason, but he wasn’t there, obviously he had passed, no dog could’ve lived as long especially one who was already as old as him. However there was another, more spry looking hound, in Tom’s old spot, so I approached him.\n\nAgain I was met with silence and decided to just rant to the dog, after all it wasn’t going to stop me was it. I went for ages, tearing up about my guilt, how I know what I’d done and begged for forgiveness. Then I heard something, whispered quietly underneath a breath. I turned to the hound to listen closer and could just barely make out what he was saying.\n\n“You take from us, we take from you”\n\nI was taken aback and walked away slowly, the dog never looked at me but I’m glad, as creepy as it was I didn’t want to face this thing head on. I walked home dejected and hardly noticed the now increasing cacophony around me that was the noise I’d been missing for years, but it was off.\n\nIt was in unison. All of them repeating the same phrase.\n\n“You take from us, we take from you”\n\nIt followed me home, more and more voices adding to the terrifying symphony as animals flocked to my location. I made it home and am now putting this post out.\n\nMy house is surrounded and there’s more voices joining by the minute. What do they want to take from me…",

          content:
            "I’ve been on bus journey’s. But not ones with seemingly no destination that I didn’t even remember boarding.\n\nI woke up with my head against an ice-cold window overlooking a crystal blue sky. \n\nThe shade of the sky was a color I couldn’t quite name. Like it was its own thing and only existed inside my mind. While the sun was more of a blur, a glorious ball of ultraviolet light sat over a horizon. It was the perfect day. \n\nAs if an image had been photoshopped and stuck to the window.\n\nI can’t remember what roused me from slumber. I think it was the sun in my eyes, intense rays of golden light flickering behind my lashes. There were other passengers with me—but I couldn’t see their faces. Instead, they were shadows, silhouettes dotted around me. Three of them.\n\nAnd when I squinted to try and find a familiar face to find my own memories, I saw nothing but faceless, almost inhuman-like beings which should have freaked me out. I should have been alarmed that they didn’t have faces, all three of them basking in warm sunlight. But I didn’t feel panicked. I didn’t feel scared. I felt numb. \n\nThe good kind of numb. It’s strange to awake with no memory, but enough of an emotional one to know that I knew this feeling. I knew what it felt like when my veins were filled with stars, and I would lie back with flickering eyes and count ceiling tiles until I fell.  Being a blank slate was relieving, in a way. Because the idea of being completely at peace with numbing my body with drugs pricked my slow-moving brain with fright. \n\nIt didn’t last long. Just for a moment, there was the sensation. Before my thoughts were foggy once more. I had no ceiling tiles to count. There was the odd pattern on the seats in front of me, though the numbers were caught in mis-matched sludge. I blinked, counting the squares. One. Two. Three. Four. Five… What came after five?\n\nOh, yeah!\n\nSix.\n\nFor a moment I was in some kind of bliss, like I was high. It felt… good, just sitting and staring out of the window, hypnotised by the scene in front of me. I laughed. Emotional memories beginning to bleed into me told me I wasn’t used to laughing without my body being filled with neutron star collisions. I wasn’t used to knowing what came after five… and ceiling tiles were my best friend. Also, the color white. \n\nI laughed again. I shaded my eyes, but my arms didn’t move. Strange. I knew I had lifted them, though my arms were exactly where they were when I had woken up; my hands sandwiched in my lap. For some reason that made me laugh again. That was before I pressed my face against the window and realized there was no real path in front of us, just a long winding road bleeding into the sky. That was when the first pricks of panic started to creep up my spine and the numbness which had seeped into my body and mind slowly began to fade. I didn’t freak out at first. When I tried to move, I found I couldn’t. \n\nThere was nothing binding my hands or holding me down, but I felt like there was. It’s weird. It felt like a phantom part of me, splinters of me which had been severed from my being were just slightly out of reach. I could feel them. But… I also couldn’t. Turning my attention to the bus itself I searched for a door. I searched for some kind of way out. Though as I was searching, my gaze flicking back and forth feverishly as a panic started to hit in bouts instead of tiny pricks—I realized there was no door. Again, I freaked out. With fight or flight igniting my mind into some kind of cohesive, I tried to get up—only for more dizzying thoughts to hit like a tidal wave, lulling me back to blankly staring out of the window.\n\n“We apologize, Kiera!” an overly-positive mechanical voice crackled from an intercom above. “To avoid complications with the beginning procedure we ask that you try and stay as still as possible or we will be forced to administer additional  sedatives.”\n\n“What?”\n\nJust like with my body, my lips felt wrong, the words more mental than physical. In front of me I noticed the other passengers moving in sharp flashes; one of them lunged from their seat in what looked like panic before I blinked, and they were back where they were originally sitting. Like I wasn’t supposed to see it. “Attempt three.” The mechanical voice said.\n\n“Now proceeding with Protocol 45ZE. Welcome, Kiera! Allow me to introduce myself! My name is Allison. I am your personal nurse. I am part of the Fix Me program, a (beta) procedure introduced to heal sick minds who have been through a great deal of trauma by being inserted into the hippocampus. I am simply here to help you, Kiera. With my help you will be able to revisit the blackened parts of yourself where I will place a protective filter.” \n\nHer words weren’t making sense, and with them, I started to panic again. And this time something happened. In a world where nothing happened, a bus on a winding path into nowhere—it was enough to send shivers creeping down my spine. I noticed it automatically. Outside, the sky darkened slightly. Just enough for me to notice.\n\n“I don’t understand what’s happening.”\n\n“It will get worse the stronger your emotions become,” Allision said. “Relax. You went on vacation with your mother in the Fall of 2003, correct? You were a child and you loved the sight of the sky clashing with the sea,” her voice sounded surprisingly human. “Would you like to see that sky? Look out of the window, and you will be able to see it. You just have to calm down.”\n\nTears pricked my eyes, and somehow they felt wrong.\n\nI hadn’t cried in a long time.\n\n“That is why we are here to help you,” Allison said. “Due to the severity of your case I cannot reveal details—only that your current mental state is severed. Without completing the Fix Me program, you will be unable to leave and unfortunately you will remain here. \n\n “Where is here?\"\n\nAllison ignored me. “Five years ago, you experienced severe trauma, Kiera.”\n\n“Stop.” I whispered.\n\n“Kiera, we can’t help you without revisiting these memories so we can remove them. We can only complete this action with your consent.”\n\nA bird slammed into the window, suddenly, with a sickening splat, exploding on impact. I watched sharp beads of red drip down the pane, my stomach starting to twist. It was just one anomaly. The sky was still bright, and the sun was shining. \n\nBut that one single crack splintering the perfect world around me had already crept its way into my mind, twisting and contorting my thoughts. “You can make it go away, Kiera,” Allison hummed. “As you can see, due to your mind starting to process your past trauma, this world will of course grow unstable with these thoughts. That is a side-effect of entering the subconscious mind and memories we have temporarily filtered for your wellbeing. But they cannot hurt you. Just like with the bird, you can wish it away.” She paused. “I will now begin attempt three of the 45ZE Protocol. You were seventeen years old in your junior year and were in the school play, correct? Kiera, if you start to feel discomfort you are free to stop the procedure. If you are able to proceed, we will begin. Do not worry, it will be like dreaming. If you would like, I can play soothing music or certain songs you have enjoyed. Rain sounds are also optional…” \n\nAllison’s  voice was practically white-noise in my head because--- yes. I was. As if a switch had been pulled inside my mind, I was remembering this specific part of my life. The backdrop of a picturesque landscape outside of the bus window bled away, and I was seventeen years old again standing on a mostly empty corridor. \n\nI wasn’t sure how technologically advanced Allison’s program was, but it wasn’t just a memory, like reliving it in a dream. I felt everything my past self did. Annoyance with maybe some anger boiling, a headache brewing behind my eyes—and kind of hungry. I had a cereal bar for breakfast and didn’t bother with lunch. Now I was deeply regretting rejecting mom’s pancakes. It was my junior year and usually I couldn’t wait to get home from school and nap, but I had drama club. Initially, I joined because of my raging crush on a senior. When she left for college, however, I found myself kind of stuck.\n\nStill, it was a club. \n\nMom was driving me crazy about my college applications and making sure they were perfect, so that meant taking extra curriculars. The drama club was the only one I could tolerate. Even if the club was full of pretentious smartasses.\n\nAn over-exaggerated sigh sliced into my thoughts.\n\n“For the thousandth time, no.”\n\nSpeaking of pretentious smartasses…\n\nIn front of me was the embodiment of the kid who asked for more homework, but an enigma in himself. Wylan Cameron was the teacher’s pet, but he was also somehow captain of the baseball team, class valedictorian and maintained being a fairly popular guy. I couldn’t see why. \n\nNot exactly conventionally attractive, he reminded me more of a sewer rat who just happened to find a sherpa jacket. The kid thought having greasy hair and an obsession with musicals was somehow a personality. However, if he happened to be the last person on earth after a nuclear explosion or zombie apocalypse, maybe he would be tolerable not to kill. It’s not like I was going to admit to him that I had raging hormones and was obsessed with every guy or girl that happened to glance at me. He just happened to be one of those who made my stomach kind of flutter. Wylan was sewer-rat cute until he opened his mouth—and annoyingly, was assistant director of our third school play. All enquiries went through him before they were passed onto our teacher. Unfair, because the guy was clearly biased. \n\nAs usual, he was taking his role of assistant director way too seriously, clutching his copy of the school play’s new script a little too tight. We had all been in the dark about what the play was, but not Wylan. He had received his copies several days before, and—yep. I could glimpse a blur of yellow highlighter. He had already started to edit, even when we had been told multiple times not to touch the scripts.\n\nI had spent almost all of lunchtime trying to track down the asshole, and from the look on his face, he had been intentionally avoiding me.\n\n“But…”\n\nHis voice was deadpan as usual. “We don’t need new members.”\n\nI couldn’t think of a comeback, my gaze glued to one single strand of his dark hair slipping from his hood.\n\n“You were looking for members yesterday,” I managed to choke out. The hallway was clearing for class. “You were trying to recruit that weird freshman kid who put a stink-bomb in the boy’s bathroom.\"\n\nHe frowned. “Didn’t you read my texts? Also, you’ve spilled coffee on your shirt.”\n\nPulling my sweater over the brown stain spattering my collar, I ignored him. “I was asleep.”\n\n“How is that my fault? You should have been awake.”\n\n“Can’t you tell me face to face like a normal human being?\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes. “Okay, fine,” Wylan folded his arms across his jacket. \n\n“Your friend is weird, Key. And I don’t mean generic teen weird, I mean really fucking weird.” His expression twisted. “Like, drawing satanic symbols all over our desks—weird. I mean telling us the world is going to end at every meeting weird.” He took a step towards me, and I caught a slight whiff of peanut butter cream. It had been three days since my best friend dumped her peanut butter milkshake over his head in the middle of the cafeteria before insisting it was for “protection” and I was sure Wylan had been the one to suggest Lily’s removal from the club. It’s not like I blamed him. Lily did act kind of strange, but I knew she was doing it because she cared about us.\n\n“First of all,” I said, trying my hardest to justify my best friend, who was slightly on the  crazy side. “They’re not satanic symbols, they’re runes.” I shoved him playfully, only to get a scowl in return. “You’re our leader, remember? So. Think of it like she was protecting you.”\n\nHe raised a brow. “They were nonsensical squiggles. Your friend is fucking crazy. Anyway. The final straw—”\n\nI cut him off. “Was it when she poured a milkshake over your head?”\n\nWylan shot me a glare. “Very funny. No, it was when she made a huge fucking deal and jumped onto her desk interrupting our read-through to announce we’re all doomed.” His expression was twisting with every word which came out of his mouth, and I knew there was no way of swaying him. “What did she say again?” Wylan laughed, tapping his chin with his pen. “Oh, yeah! That we’re doomed? Doomed. Literally. Word for word, Key. She said I’m doomed to an eternity of hell, or whatever the fuck she was talking about,” he laughed, but from the shadow in his eyes I could tell her words had freaked him out. “I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, you know? But she kept going, Key.\"\n\nI nodded. Yeah, I definitely couldn’t defend that. When I asked Lily about it, she got a funny look on her face, squeezed her eyes shut, and then told me she couldn’t see my future.\n\n“Right. Yeah.” I said, struggling to keep my own calm. Lily and I did everything together, and the last thing I needed was having to tell her that she had been removed from the drama club. “But she said ALL of us are doomed—and it was our minds, by the way. So, that could mean anything, right?” I shrugged. “Like, maybe she’s telling us we’re not going to get into college?”\n\nWylan’s lip curled, and he ran a hand through his hair. I noticed he did that a lot when he was stressed or pissed.\n\n“You’re unbelievable.”\n\n“What?!”\n\n“She was looking directly at me when she said it! You all saw her giving me those fucking freaky eyes!”\n\n“She doomed all of us!” I groaned. “It’s not even real. It’s some stupid superstition.”\n\n“Uh-huh.” He pretended to think. “Sooo, Lily somehow knowing our teacher had cancer was completely normal?”\n\n“That was a coincidence.” I said. “Why, are you scared she’s right?”\n\n“What?” He entered defensive mode. “No. Obviously not.”\n\n“Sounds like you’re scared.” I couldn’t resist a smile.\n\nHe scoffed. “Sure. Whatever. She’s out, Key. I am so sorry,” his tone dripped fake sarcasm, “For rightfully throwing out your clearly mentally unstable friend before she scares everyone away. Mrs Beck told me she’s not a fan of Lily either, so there’s no room to argue.” He inclined his head. “Unless you want to. You can send me an email which I won’t read, or a ten paragraph text trying to justify your friend sinking into the abyss of lunacy. So. If we’re done here, I need to give everyone their scripts.”\n\nWith a final smile which was more of a grimace, he turned and walked away. “Sorry!”\n\nHe spun around. “Actually. I’m not sorry. It took three washes to get the stink of shit out of my hair. Your friend needs a shrink, dude. And I say this as a friend.”\n\n“You’re an asshole, Wylan.” I said back.\n\n He snorted. “Nice talking to you as always!”\n\nThe bastard always had to have the last word. “I love being unable to differentiate whether you’re being sarcastic or serious.”\n\nWhen I didn’t move, he motioned for me to follow him. “Are you coming?” Wylan waved the scripts. “Miss Beck is revealing what play we’re doing, and I know you don’t want to be tardy..” he paused for effect like he was the main character. “Again.”\n\nHe was never going to let my one tardy go. It was at the beginning the of the semester and I had the stomach flu. People like him, however, expected me to drag myself to the club as if I wasn’t projectile vomiting. I had half a mind to walk away.\n\nBut one missed attendance meant being kicked out. The drama club took themselves (way) too seriously. “Sure.” I said and caught up to him, keeping my distance.  As usual, Wylan was as douchey as always, corking in his earphones. When I tried to make idle conversation, he made half assed hand gestures, mouthing, “I can’t hear you.” \n\nDrama club was in full swing when we entered the auditorium. Thankfully, our school was an arts school so we had a state of the art drama department and a professional looking stage. Mrs Beck, or drama teacher, a woman in her early thirties who was textbook millennial, sat on the edge of the stage with her legs swinging. When Wylan and I hurried in, the group of them twisted around to frown at us like we had just returned with an extra limb. Noah, the class clown made an “eyyyy” noise, like it was comedy genius that we were late. While Alyssa and Nina in the front row rolled their eyes and tutted. \n\nAlyssa was every theatre kid cliché but she was actually nice. Nina was the quiet kid. It took Wylan a moment for him to realize we were in trouble, and after shooting an accusing look at me, he quickened his pace into a stumbling run, practically thrust the scripts in our teacher’s face, and took his seat. \n\n“We’re five minutes early.” He said, when I had jumped into a seat at the front. Mrs Beck was doing that thing she always did when she was making a huge-deal of a latecomer. She didn’t speak for a moment, making a point to glare at us.\n\nFirst, she took a chunk out of Wylan.\n\n“Mr Cameron, I expect everyone to be at least ten minutes early when I make announcements.”\n\nWylan looked like he was going to cry—which was a plus for me. He pretended to go through his bag, but I could definitely see his shaky hands.\n\n“Yes, Mrs Beck. Sorry.”\n\nWhen I was smiling like an idiot behind the playbook I’d been handed, she turned her attention to me.\n\n“Kiera.” She made a deal of clearing her throat. “What is your excuse? I’ve said this before. The theatre does not wait for latecomers. If you were in a professional production right now, you would have a stand in to take your place, and you would be fired and jobless. That is the way the real world works. If you fail to meet basic requirements such as being on time, you will not make it in the industry. In fact, you won’t even make it to an interview since you can’t even follow basic instructions.”\n\n“It’s not like I want to go into the industry,” I muttered under my breath.\n\n“What was that?”\n\nI was about to reply when Noah dropped a copy of the playbook on this face, tipping his head back and groaning. “Dude, we’re in high school, it’s not that deep.”\n\n “That’s enough, Noah. I will treat you like adults. The theatre does not employ children.” She took an exaggerated breath.\n\n“Anyway! If you would all like to turn to page one, I would be happy to reveal the play we will be performing.”\n\nThere was a low murmur of voices, and I opened up the playbook.\n\nMrs Beck cleared her throat. “Introducing! Raw. An original production written and scripted by yours truly.”  \n\nI was half aware of my physical body still on the bus, and the low hum of the engines.\n\nThere was a sudden loud noise, what sounded like a splat—and I jumped, partly recoiling from the memory. “Kiera?” \n\nAllison’s voice was a soft hum. “Keep going. You’re okay. As I said, as memories start to show themselves to you, you will have a negative reaction. The birds are simply your mind’s way of dealing with coming to terms with selected trauma.”\n\nWhat?\n\n“The play.” Allison said. “As we go deeper, your mind will grow progressively more erratic. Please remember these memories cannot hurt you. It will seem like it of course, but they are just that. Memories. We have also applied a protective layer to ensure you are not directly influenced by them. Your mental state is currently at 46%. We need you to at least be at a 98.”\n\nA question dawned on me.\n\nIn the real world…. am I… crazy?\n\n“You are a severe case, Kiera. Would you like to know what you have been convicted of while under this influence?”\n\nNo, I just need to know… how does it get worse? I don’t understand how a school play can fuck with my head!\n\n“Right at this stage in your memory, you are at 100%. What we are going to attempt to fix is where you are 2%... then 1%... and then—”\n\nHer voice seeped away once again, just as sunlight once again began to illuminate the backs of my eyes.\n\nThe memory returned. This time, though, I was far more cautious, easing my way into it. Opening my eyes once again, I was greeted to the stage lights, and Nina’s blonde ponytail at the corner of my eye. I  turned to hiss at Noah to stop chewing on his pen— and catching Wylan’s eye, who lifted his playbook to hide his face. “Raw.” Mrs Beck said. “Follows the story of a group of high school students who, during their summer vacation, get trapped in a small, extremely suffocating, bathroom.”\n\n“Wait.” Noah held up his pen.\n\n“No questions until the end, Noah.”\n\n“Isn’t this, like, a fucked up manga?”\n\n“That’s Drifting Classroom, genius.” Alyssa didn’t turn around, though I could see her smirk. “Also, it’s a floating school, not a bathroom.”\n\nNoah scowled. “Yeah, I know that one. I’m talking about the one with the… you know… I saw a YouTube video about it.”\n\n“Kids!” Mrs Beck clapped her hands like we were preschoolers. “I am trying to read!”\n\nWylan cleared his throat, peeking behind his playbook. “I thought we weren’t kids? You did make a huge deal of saying we were adults.” He paused. “Just saying.”\n\nI thought Mrs Beck was going to throw the playbook in his face. “Stop being a smart-ass, Wylan.” And when he opened his mouth to say exactly what we all knew what he was going to say, she sighed. “And no, ass is not a curse word or a form of child abuse. I’m sure a group of seventeen year olds like yourselves can mentally manage the A word.” \n\n Rolling her eyes, Mrs Beck shuffled back on the stage, crossing her legs. “As for your questions you are all so desperately to know when I am trying to read my own work which I have been excited to show you for a long time—no. The play is an original production written by me. I can assure you I do not take my inspiration from Japanese literature. Anyway!” She was starting to go red in the cheeks, and her smile was definitely stretched too thin. “Onto actual work! The story of Raw introduces us to our main lead, Violet, and her boyfriend, Ben. I usually hold auditions for main parts. However. This year we are on a deadline. The parts of Violet and Ben will of course be played by our talented…” she made a dramatic pause, and we all collectively leaned forward.\n\nHer smile widened. “… Well, they will be revealed at the end.”\n\nI let out an annoyed breath with everyone else.\n\nShooting a look at Alyssa, the two of us mutually deciding we were the lead girl, I smiled at her. Violet was mine.\n\nAs she continued into the story, however, I started to regret throwing my hand up when Mrs Beck teased us with Violet’s part. Even Wylan looked kinda sick when I risked a glance at him as Mrs Beck graphically described these classmates brutally killing each other and then killing themselves in progressively more fucked up ways. I would actually be pretty happy being a background character—- maybe the girl right at the start who slammed her head into the mirror and died of a head injury.\n\n“Uh, Mrs Beck?”\n\nWylan interrupted her when she started talking about certain needs being met, and the philosophical question of, “We need to survive.”\n\n“Yes, Wylan?” Her eyes glittered. No doubt she was waiting for praise.\n\nHe stood up. “You did clear this with the principal, right?” I’d noticed he’d turned half of his playbook into an origami swan. “I love the idea, but isn’t this a little…” He shrugged. “I mean I’m not trying to be offensive, but it’s kinda graphic for a high school play.”\n\nShe smiled, and her smile made me feel kind of sick. “It’s the Lord of the Flies of our age, of course! Yes! Principal Carter gave me his blessing, I can assure you.”\n\nHe sat down with a grin. “Cool! In that case, I’ll take the role of Ben.”\n\n“So, they really did that in the school bathroom?” Alyssa sounded horrified, but kind of impressed.\n\n“To survive, yes.”\n\n“Gross!” She laughed. “So, it’s just like in Lord of the Flies—but like, worse?”  Admittedly, the play did grow on me, due to the sheer absurdity of the plot—- which caused us to start laughing in parts, and others hiding behind our playbooks. By the ending, we gave a standing ovation. Not because it was good, but because we had mutually agreed the play was going to be a blast to be in. Parts were announced. Wylan got Ben. Obviously. His smug smile pissed me off. Alyssa got the part of Violet because she was a drama queen, and being Alyssa, made a huge deal, making sure to make a Vine, dragging all of us into it.\n\nThe rest of us found out our parts a week later, when they were posted on the notice board in comic sans.\n\nHARTLEY HIGH SCHOOL PRESENTS: “WILD”\n\nPerformers as follows:\n\nViolet Smith — Alyssa McIntyre.\n\nBen Cross — Wylan Cameron.\n\nEthan Holding —- Noah Emory.\n\nMalia Carson —- Kiera Jarret.\n\nSunny Shields —- Wendy Tatum.\n\nI took a photo for mom, smiling to myself. Before someone tapped me on the shoulder. Her presence sent a shockwave through me and my physical body was thrown forwards suddenly. I sensed splintering glass and a darkness starting to spread in front of my eyes, a darkness I couldn’t fully see. I let out a sharp breath of air which I could hear and feel in front of me.\n\n“Keep going, Kiera.” \n\nAllison’s mechanical drawl soothed the whirlwind in my mind, and my brains attempt to recoil from the memory. “Her name is Lily, and you have to accept she is real. She existed,” her voice wobbled slightly, “She is the at the centre of your trauma and we must revisit the memory if we are going to successfully mend 1/89 separate trauma instances.”\n\nNo.\n\nI tried to pull away, but the mental grip on me was almost impressive—and when I became aware of it, I was suddenly aware of icy cold air blowing in my face.\n\nMy hands bound behind me.\n\nThe air.\n\nThe real air, which wasn’t on a simulated bus inside my mind ran by a program which was leeched onto my brain.\n\nFor a moment, just a single precious moment, I was aware of myself. My twenty two year old self. I was aware of how cold my fingers were, and a deep, cavernous feeling in the pit of my gut. The real world, for some reason, was being blocked out.\n\nWhat Allison was trying to numb.\n\nAs soon as that realization slammed into me, the program was quick. I barely felt it reach into the root of my head and violently yank me back into the memory.\n\nLily.\n\nHer explosion of golden curls made her one of the most beautiful girl’s in school—and she was my best friend.\n\n“If you know what is good for you,” Lily’s hands were trembling, so she wrapped her arms around herself to try and hide it, “You will quit the play.”\n\nI tried to smile. I really did. But she was scaring me too, just like everyone else. “I’m okay, Lily. We’re all okay.” I turned to point at the poster. “And it’s actually a good story! You should, you know..” I grabbed and squeezed her hands. “Maybe come?”\n\nLily’s eyes were swollen from crying, clumps of blonde curls hanging in her face. \n\n“I’ve been looking for you,” she whispered, her hands coming down on my shoulders. “Everywhere! I looked for you, but I can’t… I can’t see you… anywhere! I look for you, but it’s like you’re being…” she trailed off, her lip wobbling. “Drowned.” Lily’s voice choked up. “You’re being drowned by the thing…” her eyes flicked to my stomach, and something slimy crept up my throat. Before I could speak, her warm hands were stroking my gut. “The thing inside you.” Lily shook her head, sobbing. “I can’t see you anymore. I just see it.” She stumbled back, her expression growing feral. “I can… feel it.” She planted her hands over her ears. “I can hear it! I can see it!”\n\nThankfully, we were alone.\n\nThe question only grazed the back of my mind, but I was quick to shake it away.\n\nCould she mean…?\n\nNo. I was on birth control, and it was one guy at a stupid party. I would know, right? I would definitely know.\n\n“Can see… what?”\n\nNo!\n\nNo, no, no, no. I didn’t want to see this. I didn’t want to see this!\n\nI tried to pull away again, using my physical self this time to try and lunge from the chair I was strapped to.\n\n“Kiera, this is a vital memory,” Allison’s voice was like ocean waves in my head. “We have made it safe to revisit so we can heal it and make you better. As we do not have the technology to heal these memories ourselves, you must do it manually.”\n\nI couldn’t stop my hands from shaking when I wrapped my arms around Lily, burying my head in her shoulder and inhaling the smell of flowers. “What… what do you mean?” I found myself gingerly stroking my stomach. “What are you talking about?”\n\nI didn’t mean to shake her, but maybe Wylan was right to want to push her away.\n\nShe swallowed, stepping back. Lily tried to smile, tried to lie and say she was okay. “Never… never mind…” she hiccupped. “I should go.”\n\nBefore she could move, I grasped her hand. “Hey.” I spoke softly. “What did you… you know… see?”\n\nInstead of answering me, she reached into her pocket and pressed a colored rock into my hand, curling my fingers into fist around it. “On opening night,” Lily whispered. “You are going to fall.” She hiccupped again. “Deep, deep down, Key. So far down I can’t see you anymore.” She swiped at her face with her sleeves. “You need to quit. Fake sickness. Go far, far away.”\n\n“Like, fall off the stage?”\n\nThose were my original words echoing in the back of my head.\n\nThis time, I stabled myself in the memory and tightened my grip on Lily. But as I did, the memory continued as it always had with Lily walking away. “Kiera, you cannot change your memories,” Allison said. “It is possible, yes. This is how the process of healing is applied. However, there is a safety protocol put in place to ensure you do not do this in the case of the procedure being hijacked.”\n\nHijacked?!\n\nAs if the word itself had caused my thoughts to spiral once more, the simulation around me once again started to come apart; shadows bleeding from the dark began their creep towards me. “Focus on your memory, Kiera.” Allison’s voice said calmly.\n\nI did.\n\nIt’s not like I could try and reach out for the real world, which had once again crumbled around me.\n\nLily stumbled away before I could question her— and I was left on an eerily empty school corridor with a bad feeling suddenly curling in my gut.\n\n“Lily!”\n\nI called after her, but she didn’t turn around, bleeding into a silhouette.\n\nLily stopped coming to school.\n\nAccording to her texts, it was the flu. But Lily didn’t use periods in her texts, and the lack of the emojis was making me wary. \n\nI spent the next few weeks rehearsing for the play. The kids in the art department built a crazy set, and I felt like a real performer. The night before opening night, I caught the set designer students dragging in a large white bag. They were wearing masks. As I got closer, I could tell why. The thing smelled like an actual decaying corpse. When it was dragged on stage for final rehearsals, Alyssa paled. She looked like she was going to throw up. “Is that what we’re supposed to eat?”\n\nMrs Beck nodded with a wide smile. “Indeed it is! I have worked in several theatre productions, so a friend of a friend provided us with this prop!”\n\nWylan crouched in front of it. “Well, it smells authentic. What is it?”\n\nThe teacher pulled the zipper, and the group of us leapt back.\n\nA scream clawed its way up my throat, my gut twisting into knots. The prop was… realistic. Way too realistic.\n\nIt was a mannequin stuffed with what looked like raw sausage meat and ground beef soaked in food coloring.\n\nI poked the body, my stomach dancing.\n\nYep. Definitely plastic.\n\n“We need to eat that?” Noah shrieked. “Dude. That’s fucking raw meat!”\n\nMrs Beck sighed. “It’s jackfruit, Noah. Commonly used to resemble human body parts. It’s perfectly fine for human consumption. There’s chicken, too.”\n\nWylan let out a choked laugh, poking at the prop corpse’s face. “Mmmm!” He mocked, shooting me a smirk. “Don’t you just dry chicken strips covered in food coloring.” He swiped his fingers on the front of his sweater. “Better than a McDonald’s.”\n\nThankfully, the prop was taken away, and we did one last dress rehearsal. It went as well as you would think. Mrs Beck’s idea to let us have soda and pizza backfired. I fucked up my lines, almost giving Mrs Beck a coronary, Wylan fell off the stage twice and miraculously didn’t break anything, and Lyssa and Noah were found backstage having sex when they were supposed to be, you know… playing their parts. Two critical members screwing, while the rest of us were slowly going crazy from the amount of times we had to run through the play. I don’t think that was a side effect of soda and pizza of Alyssa and Noah hooking up. The two of them had been drowning in sexual tension for a while, it was painful, so it wasn’t really surprising.\n\nOpening night came, and I was almost throwing up from nerves.\n\n“Gather around! Gather around!”\n\nMrs Beck gathered us in a circle five minutes before show time and produced a leather bound bottle. Noah whooped, and Wylan of course started the, “But Mrs Beck, we are technically minors” conversation. He was overruled, as all of us agreed (even him) that it was a treat. \n\nI downed my glass straight away, wincing at the odd taste. I didn’t like wine usually, but this tasted kind of sweet. I noticed it perked up all of us, sending us into a sort of frenzy. I wasn’t sure what percentage of alcohol in one glass was, but it was either these kids were pretending to be drunk, or at least behaving erratically, or Mrs Beck had accidentally gotten her performers drunk on opening night. It started with Noah, who was suddenly starving. I caught him backstage stuffing salted peanuts in his mouth, demanding the art students to go grab him more. Alyssa disappeared for a while and was found lying face down on the school corridor, taking questionable selfies. She’d spilled grape juice everywhere.\n\nIt was dripping from her, staining her clothes and hands and pooling across the corridor.\n\n“Do you know what’s going on?”\n\nWylan, usually the one who was allergic to fun, grabbed me suddenly, forcing me into an awkward dance. He too was taking advantage of the refreshments, his mouth filled with a combination of chocolate and chips. \n\nHe too had somehow gotten hold of grape juice. I could see it staining his lips and teeth. It was thick and deep red, tainting him.  \n\nGrinning through a mushy combination of both, the boy's grasp was tightening. “We definitely shouldn’t have had wine, he giggled, burping. When he pulled me to his chest, hot breath in my face, he started to move forwards, jaw clenching, eyes suddenly far too blank for me to fully understand. But I was too busy being very wary that my stomach was sickeningly empty, and my mouth was watering.\n\n“Hey! What the fuck are you two—woah!”\n\nThe set designer kid dropped whatever he’d been holding, his hands slamming over his mouth.\n\nTwisting around, I snapped out of it, and my head felt weird. The kid’s was definitely talking, but I couldn’t hear him. His voice was being drowned out by ocean waves roaring. The air was too thick. I shook my head, but I was already being dragged onto stage— where I somehow managed to kick into performer mode. Mom was in the audience, though when I risked a peek, I couldn’t see anything. \n\nShadows and silhouettes. I noticed there was some commotion right at the back. The doors were open, and whispers were starting. But I ignored them. The play went better than I thought. Luckily, the wine didn’t go to our heads, each of us delivering a stellar performance. It was towards the end, when Wylan was shouting a monologue to the audience, and the group of us were in position, where the girl paying Sunny would sneak under stage and be replaced with the prop of her body—- was when I started to smell it. \n\nRoast chicken. \n\nNo. Better. My mom’s chicken hot pot, steamed potatoes and gravy, and steamed broccoli. “What were we supposed to do?” Wylan asked the audience. His voice collapsed into white noise in my ears.\n\nIf I strained my ears, I swore I could hear… screaming.\n\nI could barely sense their footsteps, as Sunny’s performer was pulled from the stage, and… there it was. The smell.\n\nSo good. An aroma which filled me eliciting something electric.\n\nThe prop was in front of us, and it was the final scene. There was supposed to be a cue, but I couldn’t stand it. I was ripping through the bag and struggling with the zip, and when I had fistfuls of jackfruit and chicken strips, stuffing them into my mouth, I couldn’t stop. Sunny’s body was so well-done. I was amazed and a little horrified how lifelike her flesh was and how easy it was to tear from her bones. \n\nThe others dropped down beside me, and I was aware of the whimper which suddenly escaped Wylan's lips, before I dragged him down with me, forcing fake flesh into his mouth. Noah and Alyssa followed suit. I was aware I was moaning. Loudly. I ripped and pulled and tore at the prop until  I could see pearly white. \n\nI started giggling. There was no laughing in the script, but I laughed, warm red messing my mouth and chin. And when the audience were clapping, and I was getting to my feet, dizzy, grasping the others’ hand, and bowing—I couldn’t stop smiling. I bowed again, while red seeped across the stage. It was running down my shirt and dripping down my chin. Someone in the audience screamed suddenly.\n\nAlyssa’s mother standing in the front fainted.\n\nThe mechanical voice was back, but it sounded different.\n\n“No, Kiera. This is not what happened. Go back. Remove the filter they put over your memory and see things clearly.”\n\nI sensed another bird slamming into the window inside the simulation, and my body being thrown forwards, the bus quaking with me. \n\n“Do it.”\n\nThis time her voice was firm.\n\nThe memory blurred, and I was back in front of Noah, right before the play. He was stuffing something into his mouth.\n\nNot salted peanuts.\n\nFingers.\n\nFingers which were still moving, poking from his clenched teeth.\n\nAlyssa.\n\nI caught her lying face down on the school corridor. She was covered in it, slick scarlet. Blood. Not grape juice. The girl was mindlessly mauling on an eyeball. \n\nBiting through it, she shot me a grin, and snapped a pic of herself. Wylan grabbed hold of me, pulling me into a dance, spinning me around a maniacal giggle escaping his mouth leaking thick, deep red scarlet which dripped down his chin. His mouth was full of stringy flesh stuck between his teeth as he spun me around and around, and I was aware of the state of myself. My fingers entangled with his were wet and slimy. Wylan stumbled, his eyes not quite penetrating me. “We definitely shouldn’t have had wine,” he laughed, and I nodded along, doing another clumsy spin.\n\n“Hey!”\n\nTurning around, one of the art director students was staring at us, horrified. “What the… what the fuck are you doing?!” He started towards us, “We need to get you help,” he whispered, his eyes were wide. “Kiera. Wylan. Who did this to you?”\n\nEverything went fast forward after that, like my memories were being purposely rewound.\n\nOn stage, Wylan’s gasp of delight, when a body was brought in front of us.\n\nI dove in, carving my fingernails into already shredded flesh, stuffing myself with… I caught exactly what my fists were full of.\n\nHer.\n\nLily.\n\nRecoiling in horror, Wylan did the same. But the smell of her was driving me…\n\nCrazy.\n\nSo, I grabbed him, forcing a fistful of Lily into his mouth and made him chew on it until he was helping himself.\n\nWith my best friend dripping down my shirt and in my mouth, we bowed in front of an audience.\n\nThey were… clapping.\n\nNo. I squinted.\n\nNo, there wasn’t an audience. \n\nInstead, our parents and friends were at the back of the auditorium, a blur of screaming masses being held back by cops.\n\nThat was when four numbers appeared in front of my eyes suddenly.\n\n4879\n\nAnd a voice pricked into my head.\n\n“Kiera, sweetie, can you hear me? Could you read out those four numbers for me, please? There’s a good girl.” \n\n. \n\nI'll be back soon with an update. I'm supposed to be writing this for therapy, but I found myself here.

            "  Ontario  \n\n So my credit has taken a bit of a beating, due to a couple surgeries and time off work.   My c/c's have been utilized way too much.  I know that.  \n\nNow my landlord is selling, and I need to find another home.  My daughter, and her spouse are on ODSP, and have a small child.  \n\nWe are currently paying about $1700/month .  New place would be about $200 more a month.\n\nLandlord is willing to give us $6K to move out by Sept.  \n\nI have about $5k in an RRSP.  My credit score is about 615.   All my bills are paid on time, and I have an excellent reference letter from this landlord of 8 years.\n\nMy daughter's credit score is about the same.\n\nQuestion is:  how much of a difference would it make to withdraw this $5k, and put it onto my c/c's... will it boost enough on my credit report?    \nWe've already been turned down by a property management company- I'm guessing because our scores are too low.\n\nIs it worth doing this?  or should I just keep hoping for a smaller landlord that I can talk to in person?  etc.  I have also been employed by the same company for over 23 years...  Just have a lower score.... \n\nThanks in advance",

Similar to how typescript provides type safety at compile time, Dilav provides type safety at run-time.\n\nDilav is fast and has an intuitive api, making it simple to use.\n\nThis is the first public release in alpha.  As the architecture is clean and simple, I don't anticipate it taking long to reach full production readiness.\n\nIf you have an interest in or suggestions for the project, then I'd be glad to hear from you.  It's early days, so there is still significant opportunity to shape this into an awesome tool which benefits the community.\n\n[GitHub repository](https://github.com/TrevTheDev/monorepo/tree/main/packages/dilav)\n\n[npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dilav)",

            "For my part, i really like this movie. Despite the negative critics, i think Vin Diesel was very well casted in the main role.\n\nThe Story is good, intriguing and keep me entertain. \n\nAt first i thaught the movie would be set in medieval time, so i was very surprise by the modern setting... \n\nLike i said in my first lines, Vin Diesel is very interesting in is Viking outfit. Too bad we dont see him more in the medieval era in the movie. But otherwise i really enjoyed seeing him in a Fantasy (Dark Fantasy) movie...\n\nThe soundtrack is good...\n\nThis is one movie i keep enjoying more i view it...\n\nFor my ratings i eillgo that way \n\n0 = Very Bad\n1-5 = Bad\n6-10 = so so\n11-14 = good\n15 = Very Good\n16-19 = Great\n20 = Perfect\n\nAt the end i will add the scores to rate on 100\n\nSo my ratings go like these : \n\nStory telling: 12/20 \nThrills/fun/entertainment : 15/20\nCasting : 17/20\nScores (music) : 14/20\nRewachability : 20/20\n\nTotal: 78/100",

Should I be worried about pic 3 and pic 4? \n\nAll four are in the same tent. First (golden teachers) is going on it’s third flush. Second (APE) is starting to pin. Third (Jedi Mind Fucks) and fourth (JMF) are two weeks behind, but appear unhealthy (maybe?). Heat is 78°-79°, humidity at 95-98%, CO2 levels <1000ppm, an hour of light every other hour. All controlled.",

            "I've been reading the same books for years. I don't enjoy heavy meaning in books thanks to several college courses on literature analysis so I mostly stick to YA novels. I don't object to violence or X rated activity, but I do prefer fantasy. \n\nBooks I've already read:\n\nThe Eragon series\n\nHarry Potter\n\nPercy Jackson and pretty much everything else Rick Riordan has written for teens.\n\nLOTR\n\nMost of Robin McKinley's stuff\n\nThe Wicked Lovely series by Melissa Marr\n\nFred the Vampire Accountant series\n\nHollow Kingdom series by Clare Dunkle\n\nHunger Games\n\nDivergent\n\nThe Giver\n\nThat's definitely not an exhaustive list of all the books I've ever read but it is what I can think of that fits the description. Appreciate any and all suggestions! Thanks Reddit!",
